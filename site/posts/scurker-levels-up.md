Welcome to the new and improved scurker.com! I'd never felt comfortable with my previous design and never really felt inspired by it. There had been some things that I had felt had been missing, and the site lacked a lot of flexibility I was looking for. Shortly after my previous design had been launched, I begin work on this iteration giving time for things to settle in. What has changed?

### Standards Are Dead? ###

Well technically, no. Previously I have been using XHTML 1.0 strict, but have now switched to an HTML 5 doctype, which is simple as `<!DOCTYPE html>`. The majority of the features I plan on using are quite usable across most major browsers, so I see little reason not to make the switch.

### Portfolio ###

Thanks to features added with Wordpress 3.0, this has given me the ability to update new additions to the portfolio that much easier!

### No More Boring Fonts! ###

Goodbye Trebuchet MS, hello @font-face! Web fonts have wide support in a majority of browsers, so why not take advantage of it? The [Google Font API](http://code.google.com/webfonts) is a great resource for doing so.

This is only a portion of the site as the rest should come around the corner of the holidays. Please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions below.
